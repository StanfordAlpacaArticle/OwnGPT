Alpaca_data.json contains 52K instruction-following data we used for fine-tuning the Alpaca model. This JSON file is a list of dictionaries, each dictionary contains the following fields:

instruction: str, describes the task the model should perform. Each of the 52K instructions is unique.
input: str, optional context or input for the task. For example, when the instruction is "Summarize the following article", the input is the article. Around 40% of the examples have an input.
output: str, the answer to the instruction as generated by text-davinci-003.
We used the following prompts for fine-tuning the Alpaca model:
